ohh I see! use attached csv file, with one column per participant
 and in rows the weddings of day 2 in ascending order 
 (i.e., that is not the order in which they have seen the weddings of course,
  because they did not necessarily see the wedding 
  in order 1,2,6,17,19,20,22,23,28,29,34,38). 
  And then what is in each of these elements in coded like this: 

NA is  campfire-coin-egg

NB is flower-torch-painting



SA is campfire-torch-egg

SB is flower-coin-painting
